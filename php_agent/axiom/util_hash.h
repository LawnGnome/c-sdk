/*
 * Purpose : Compute a new path hash for outgoing CAT requests.
 *
 * Params  : 1. The name of the current transaction.
 *           2. The application name.
 *           3. The referring path hash, or NULL if there is no referring hash.
 *
 * Returns : A newly allocated string containing the new hash, or NULL if an
 *           error occurred.

/*
 * Purpose : Compute a non-cryptographic hash of a string.
 *
 * Params  : 1. The string to compute the hash for. NULL or the empty string
 *              will always both evaluate to 0.
 *           2. Pointer to a variable that holds the string length. If this is
 *              NULL or currently points to a 0 value, the string MUST be NUL
 *              terminated and its length is computed, and the length stored
 *              here.
 *
 * Returns : The hash.
 *
 * Note    : The algorithm implemented by this function is MurmurHash3, which
 *           is a freely licensed algorithm that is faster and experiences
 *           fewer collisions than JSHash, which we used up to and including
 *           4.21. Calling code should not rely on a particular function being
 *           used: algorithm used by this function can and will change over
 *           time.
