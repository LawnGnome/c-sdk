## C Agent

Generic library to communicate with New Relic.

### Requirements
* 64-bit Linux with
  * glibc 2.5+ with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher
  * kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26+ highly recommended)
  * libpcre 8.13+
  * libpthread

### Getting started

Instrument your code:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <limits.h>
#include <float.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "libnewrelic.h"

int main (void) {
  newrelic_app_t *app = 0;
  newrelic_txn_t *txn = 0;
  newrelic_config_t *config = 0;

  config = newrelic_new_config ("C Agent Test App", "<LICENSE_KEY_HERE>");
  strcpy (config->daemon_socket, "/tmp/.newrelic.sock");
  strcpy (config->log_filename, "./c_agent.log");
  config->log_level = LOG_INFO;

  /* Wait up to 10 seconds for the agent to connect to the daemon */
  app = newrelic_create_app (config, 10000);
  free (config);

  /* Start a web transaction */
  txn = newrelic_start_web_transaction (app, "veryImportantWebTransaction");

  /* Add attributes */
  newrelic_add_attribute_int (txn, "my_custom_int", INT_MAX);
  newrelic_add_attribute_string (txn, "my_custom_string", "String String String");

  sleep (1);

  /* End web transaction */
  newrelic_end_transaction (&txn);

  /* Start and end a non-web transaction */
  txn = newrelic_start_non_web_transaction (app, "veryImportantOtherTransaction");
  sleep (1);

  newrelic_end_transaction (&txn);

  newrelic_destroy_app (&app);

  return 0;
}
```

Link your app against the library. The C agent currently ships as a static
library, so you must also link against libpcre and libpthread. For example:

```
gcc -o test_app test_app.c -L. -lnewrelic -lpcre -pthread
```

Start the daemon:

```
./bin/daemon -f -logfile stdout -loglevel debug
```

Run your test application and check the `c-agent.log` file for output.

### Features
* Transactions
  * Transaction events
  * Web and non-web transactions
  * Custom attributes
  * Error instrumentation
* Logging levels

#### Error instrumentation

The agent provides the function `newrelic_notice_error()` so that customers 
may record transaction errors that are not automatically handled by the agent.  
Errors recorded in this manner are displayed in 
[error traces](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/error-analytics/error-analytics-explore-events-behind-errors#traces-table)
at New Relic's Error Analytics dashboard; they are available to query through
[New Relic Insights](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights).  

When recording an error using `newrelic_notice_error()`, callers must supply four 
parameters to the function, as indicated in `libnewrelic.h`. Among these 
parameters are `priority` and `errclass`. 

The agent is capped at reporting 100 errors per minute.  In the pool of errors 
collected by the agent, the `priority` of an error indicates which errors should 
be saved in the event that the error limit of the number of errors reported 
to New Relic is reached. Higher values take priority over lower values.

Errors are grouped by class in New Relic's Error Analytics dashboard. With that in
mind, the `errclass` parameter gives the caller control over how to filter for 
errors on the dashboard.

Customers may now use `newrelic_notice_error()` to record error instrumentation in
their transactions.  Errors recorded in this manner are displayed in 
[error traces] (https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/error-analytics/error-analytics-explore-events-behind-errors#traces-table)
and are available to query through 
[New Relic Insights](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights).  
See `libnewrelic.h` for usage information.


### About

#### Thread safety
If you want to do anything beyond timing (e.g. events or attributes),
transactions are *not* thread safe. Scope transactions to single threads.

#### Agent-daemon communication
The agent makes blocking writes to the daemon. Unless the kernel is resource-
starved, it will handle these writes efficiently.

#### Memory management
The C Agent's memory use is proportional to the amount of data sent. The libc
calls `malloc` and `free` are used extensively. The dominant memory cost is
user-provided data, including custom attributes, events, and metric names.

#### Elevated privileges (sudo)
By default the logs will be saved in "/var/log/newrelic/c_agent.log" and needs
elevated privileges to execute properly. To avoid running the application with
these privileges have the log files saved in a location that can be written to
by the current user.
