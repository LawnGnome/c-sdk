This directory contains unit tests for Axiom. Building and running the
tests should be a standard part of the Hudson builds, and developers should be
constantly improving these tests, especially to catch regressions. There is a
very basic framework provided, and this could certainly use some beefing up.
The framework compiles the very basic functions needed by most other tests and
provides a mechanism for reporting test success and failure in a somewhat
friendly manner.

As much as possible, code in the source directory should not be sprinkled with
things like #ifdef TESTING. The problem with that is that the code paths are
different when that macro is defined versus when it isn't. However, there are
some cases where this is unavoidable.
