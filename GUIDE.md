# C Agent

Generic library to communicate with New Relic.

## Requirements
* 64-bit Linux with
  * glibc 2.5+ with NPTL support
  * kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26+ highly recommended)
  * libpcre 8.20+
  * libpthread

## Getting started

Instrument your code. Consider the brief program below or look at the
`examples` directory for source and Makefiles highlighting particular features.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <limits.h>
#include <float.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include "libnewrelic.h"

int main (void) {
  int priority = 50;
  newrelic_app_t *app = 0;
  newrelic_txn_t *txn = 0;
  newrelic_config_t *config = 0;
  newrelic_segment_t *segment1, *segment2;

  config = newrelic_new_config("Your Application Name", "<LICENSE_KEY_HERE>");
  strcpy(config->daemon_socket, "/tmp/.newrelic.sock");
  strcpy(config->log_filename, "./c_agent.log");
  config->log_level = LOG_INFO;

  /* Wait up to 10 seconds for the agent to connect to the daemon */
  app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000);
  free(config);

  /* Start a web transaction */
  txn = newrelic_start_web_transaction(app, "veryImportantWebTransaction");

  /* Add attributes */
  newrelic_add_attribute_int(txn, "my_custom_int", INT_MAX);
  newrelic_add_attribute_string(txn, "my_custom_string",
                                "String String String");

  sleep(1);

  /* Record an error */
  newrelic_notice_error(txn, priority, "Meaningful error message",
                        "Error.class");

  /* Add segments */
  segment1 = newrelic_start_segment(txn, "Stuff", "Secret");
  sleep (1);
  newrelic_end_segment(txn, &segment1);

  segment2 = newrelic_start_segment(txn, "More Stuff", "Secret");
  sleep (2);
  newrelic_end_segment(txn, &segment2);

  /* End web transaction */
  newrelic_end_transaction(&txn);

  /* Start and end a non-web transaction */
  txn =
      newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(app, "veryImportantOtherTransaction");
  sleep(1);

  newrelic_end_transaction(&txn);

  newrelic_destroy_app(&app);

  return 0;
}
```

Compile and link your application against the static library, `libnewrelic.a`. There
are two considerations to make during the linking step. First, because
`libnewrelic.a` is offered as a static library, because it is already linked
with the `libpcre`, `libpthread`, and `lm` libraries, you must also link
against these three libraries to avoid symbol collisions in the linking step.

Second, to take full advantage of error traces at New Relic's Error Analytics
dashboard, link your application using GNU's `-rdynamic` linker flag.
Doing so means that more meaningful information appears in the stack trace
for the error recorded on a transaction using `newrelic_notice_error()`.

With these two considerations in mind, one may compile and link a simple application
like so:

```sh
gcc -o test_app test_app.c -L. -lnewrelic -lpcre -lm -pthread -rdynamic
```

Start the daemon:

```sh
./bin/daemon -f -logfile stdout -loglevel debug
```

Run your test application and check the `c-agent.log` file for output.

## Features
* Transactions
  * Transaction events
  * Web and non-web transactions
  * Custom attributes
  * Error instrumentation
  * Segments
* Logging levels

### Segment Instrumentation

The agent provides several API functions for creating optional *segment*
instrumentation.  Segments allow you to measure the time taken by specific
portions of a transaction.  The agent allows you to create two different
segment types.

* External Segments
* Datastore Segments

### External Segments

The agent provides two functions, `newrelic_start_external_segment()` and
`newrelic_end_external_segment()` that allows end-user-programmers to create
external segments. External segments appear in the transaction "Breakdown
table" and in the "External services" page in APM.

* [More info on External Services page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/external-services-page)

Timing an external segment transaction is a three-step process.

1. Create a `newrelic_external_segment_params_t` struct that describes the external
   segment

2. Start the timer with `newrelic_start_external_segment()`

3. Stop the timer with `newrelic_end_external_segment()`

Here are those three steps in code.  The `txn` variable below is a
transaction, created via `newrelic_start_web_transaction()` or
`newrelic_start_non_web_transaction()`. Segments may only be recorded on
active transactions.

```c
    newrelic_external_segment_params_t params = {
        .procedure = "GET",
        .uri       = "https://httpbin.org/delay/1",
    };

    newrelic_external_segment_t* segment = newrelic_start_external_segment(txn, &params);

    // The external call to be timed goes here

    newrelic_end_external_segment(txn, &segment);
```

The `newrelic_external_segment_params_t` struct contains a list of parameters
that New Relic will use to identify a segment. These parameters also drive
the user interface in APM. Only the `.uri` field is required. Documentation
for each field can be found in `libnewrelic.h`. You can also find a working
code sample in `examples/ex_external.c`.

**IMPORTANT**:  In order to ensure accurate timing, external segments cannot
be nested within other external segments, and cannot be nested with datastore
segments. You **must** call `newrelic_end_external_segment()` before starting
a new external segment with `newrelic_start_external_segment()`. Starting a
new segment before the previous segment has ended will produce undefined
results, and should be avoided.

### Datastore Segments

The agent provides two functions, `newrelic_start_datastore_segment()` and
`newrelic_end_datastore_segment()` that allow you to create datastore
segments.  APM uses segments recorded in this manner in the
[Databases and Slow Queries](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/databases-slow-queries-page)
of APM.  Segments created with these functions
also populate the `databaseDuration` attribute of a
[New Relic Insights](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights)
Transaction event.

To record a datastore segment on an active transaction, you'll need to

1. Create a `newrelic_datastore_segment_params_t` struct that describes the
   datastore segment

2. Start the timer with `newrelic_start_datastore_segment()`

3. Stop the timer with `newrelic_end_datastore_segment()`

Here are those three steps in code. The `txn` variable below is a
transaction, created via `newrelic_start_web_transaction()` or
`newrelic_start_non_web_transaction()`.  You may only record segments on
active transactions.

```c
    txn = newrelic_start_web_transaction(app, "aTransactionName");

    /* ... */

    newrelic_datastore_segment_params_t params = {
        .product = NEWRELIC_DATASTORE_MYSQL,
        .collection = "table_name",
        .operation = "select",
        .host = "db.example.com",
        .port_path_or_id = "3306",
        .database_name = "db_accounting_1",
        .query =
            "SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE foo_bar = 'Foo Bar' "};

    newrelic_datastore_segment_t* segment =
        newrelic_start_datastore_segment(txn, &params);

    // the code you want to time goes here

    newrelic_end_datastore_segment(txn, &segment);
```

The `newrelic_datastore_segment_params_t` struct contains a list of
parameters that New Relic uses to identify your segment. New Relic also uses
these values to drive its user interface in APM. Only the `.product` field is
required. You can find documentation for each field in `libnewrelic.h`. You
can also find a working code sample in `examples/ex_datastore.c`.

**IMPORTANT**:  In order to ensure accurate timing, datastore segments cannot
be nested within other datastore segments, and cannot be nested with external
segments. You **must** call `newrelic_end_datastore_segment()` before
starting a new datastore or external segment. Starting a new segment before
the previous segment has ended will produce undefined results, and should be
avoided.

#### Slow Query Tracing for Datastore Segments

When you send New Relic datastore segments, those segments may be eligible
for
[Slow Query tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/viewing-slow-query-details).
Only SQL-like databases are eligible for slow query tracing.   If your
datastore segment's `.product` is set to `Firebird`, `Informix`, `MSSQL`,
`MySQL`, `Oracle`, `Postgres`, `SQLite`, or `Sybase`, the C-Agent will make
your segment eligible for slow query tracing.

Both the time threshold to trigger a slow query trace and whether slow query
tracing is enabled are controlled via the C-Agent's **application**
configuration, specifically the `datastore_reporting.*` fields.

```c
    config = newrelic_new_config("C Agent Test App", "<LICENSE_KEY_HERE>");
    /* ... */
    config->transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.enabled = true;
    config->transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.threshold_us = 500000;
    app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000);
    free(config);

    /* ... */

    /* Start a web transaction */
    txn = newrelic_start_web_transaction(app, "yourTransactionName");

    /* datastore segments created during the `txn` transaction
       will be eligable for slow query traces if the segment time
       is greater than 500,000 microseconds (0.5 seconds) */

    /* ...  */
```

### Error instrumentation

The agent provides the function `newrelic_notice_error()` so that customers
may record transaction errors. Errors recorded in this manner are displayed in
[error traces](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/error-analytics/error-analytics-explore-events-behind-errors#traces-table)
at New Relic's Error Analytics dashboard; they are available to query through
[New Relic Insights](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights).

When recording an error using `newrelic_notice_error()`, callers must supply four
parameters to the function, as indicated in `libnewrelic.h`. Among these
parameters are `priority` and `errclass`.

The agent is capped at reporting 100 error traces per minute. Supposing that over
100 errors are noticed during a single minute, the total number of errors are
reported in New Relic metrics; only 100 would be available at the Error Analytic's
dashboard. That said, in the pool of errors collected by the agent, the `priority`
of an error indicates which errors should be saved in the event that the cap has
been exceeded. Higher values take priority over lower values.

Errors are grouped by class in New Relic's Error Analytics dashboard. With that in
mind, the `errclass` parameter gives the caller control over how to filter for
errors on the dashboard.

With a valid application, `app`, created using `newrelic_create_app()`, one can
start a transaction, record an error, and end a transaction like so:

```c
 int priority = 50;
 newrelic_txn_t* txn = newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(app, transaction_name);

 ...

 if (err) {
    newrelic_notice_error(txn, priority, ""Meaningful error message", "Error.class");
 }

 ...

 newrelic_end_transaction(&txn);
```

As noted above, to take full advantage of the error trace feature available
at New Relic's Error Analytics dashboard, applications should be linked using
GNU's `-rdynamic` linker flag. For the example `ex_notice_error.c` in the
`examples` directory, using this linker flag means that symbols are available
to list the function calls in the error's backtrace, like so:


```
   ./ex_notice_error.out(newrelic_get_stack_trace_as_json+0x2e) [0x40ae6d]
   ./ex_notice_error.out(newrelic_notice_error+0x204) [0x40a679]
   ./ex_notice_error.out(record_error+0x2c) [0x409822]
   ./ex_notice_error.out(main+0xe8) [0x40990d]
   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xf0) [0x7ffade6e7830]
   ./ex_notice_error.out(_start+0x29) [0x409729]
```

The backtrace shows that the `main()` function calls `record_error()` which
calls `newrelic_notice_error()`. Without the `-rdynamic` flag, the
function symbols are not available, and so the backtrace may not be as
meaningful:

```
    ./ex_notice_error.out() [0x4037fd]
    ./ex_notice_error.out() [0x403009]
    ./ex_notice_error.out() [0x4021b2]
    ./ex_notice_error.out() [0x40229d]
    /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xf0) [0x7f39062d6830]
    ./ex_notice_error.out() [0x4020b9]
```

### Creating Custom Events

The agent provides a Custom Events API that allows users to send custom events to
New Relic Insights.  To send an event, start a transaction and use the
`newrelic_create_custom_event` and `newrelic_record_custom_event` functions

```c
    // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, create via newrelic_start_web_transaction
    // see above examples for more information

    newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0;
    custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event("aTypeForYourEvent");
    newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event);
```

You can also add `int`, `long`, `double`, and `char*` (string) attributes to your event
via the `newrelic_custom_event_add_*` family of functions.

```c
    newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0;
    custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event("aTypeForYourEvent");

    newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int(custom_event, "keya", 42);
    newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long(custom_event, "keyb", 84);
    newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double(custom_event, "keyc", 42.42);
    newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string(custom_event, "keyd", "A string");

    newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event);
```

Don't forget to review the
[Insights custom data requirements and limits](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/insights-custom-data-requirements-limits)
for guidance on what are and aren't allowed values inside of a custom event.

#### Memory Lifecycle for Custom Events

Under normal circumstances, the `newrelic_record_custom_event` function will
free the memory allocated when you called `newrelic_create_custom_event`.
If you you end up creating a custom event that you do NOT need to record,
you may use the `newrelic_discard_custom_event` function to free the allocated
memory in order to avoid leaks in your program.

```c
    newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0;
    custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event("aTypeForYourEvent");

    // circumstances

    newrelic_discard_custom_event(&custom_event);
```

### Custom Metrics

The agent provides the function `newrelic_record_custom_metric`, which allows users to
record custom timing metrics. To create a custom metric, just provide a name/identifier
and an amount of time in milliseconds to the function, (along with the active
transaction).

```c
    // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, create via newrelic_start_web_transaction

    // Record a metric value of 100ms in the transaction txn
    newrelic_record_custom_metric(txn, "Custom/YourMetric/Label", 100);
```

**Important**: Start all metric names with `Custom/`; for example,
`Custom/MyMetric/My_label`. The `Custom/` prefix is required for all custom metrics.

To learn more about collecting custom metrics, including naming strategies to
avoid metric grouping issues (also calls MGIs) read the
[Collect Custom Metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics)
documentation.

## About

### Thread safety
If you want to do anything beyond timing (e.g. events or attributes),
transactions are *not* thread safe. Scope transactions to single threads.

### Agent-daemon communication
The agent makes blocking writes to the daemon. Unless the kernel is resource-
starved, it will handle these writes efficiently.

### Memory management
The C Agent's memory use is proportional to the amount of data sent. The libc
calls `malloc` and `free` are used extensively. The dominant memory cost is
user-provided data, including custom attributes, events, and metric names.

### Elevated privileges (sudo)
By default the logs will be saved in "/var/log/newrelic/c_agent.log" and needs
elevated privileges to execute properly. To avoid running the application with
these privileges have the log files saved in a location that can be written to
by the current user.
