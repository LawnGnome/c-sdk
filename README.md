# New Relic C SDK

This is the New Relic C SDK! If your application does not use other New Relic 
APM agent languages, you can use the C SDK to take advantage of New Relic's
monitoring capabilities and features to instrument a wide range of applications.

## Need Help?

Here are recommendations for learning more:

* Documentation is available at 
[docs.newrelic.com](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/c-sdk-table-contents)
and [GUIDE.md](https://github.com/newrelic/c-sdk/blob/master/GUIDE.md?).

* API usage information can be found in libnewrelic.h, available in the 
[include directory](https://github.com/newrelic/c-sdk/tree/master/include). 
Other header files are internal to the agent, and their stability 
is not guaranteed. 

* Working examples are available in the 
[examples directory](https://github.com/newrelic/c-sdk/tree/master/examples).

## Requirements

The C SDK works on 64-bit Linux operating systems with:

* gcc 4.8 or higher
* glibc 2.17 or higher
* Kernel version 2.6.26 or higher
* libpcre 8.20 or higher
* libpthread

Running unit tests requires cmake 2.8 or higher.

Compiling the New Relic daemon requires Go 1.4 or higher.

## Building the C SDK

If your system meets the requirements, building the C SDK and 
daemon should be as simple as:

```sh
make
```

This will create two files in this directory:

* `libnewrelic.a`: the static C SDK library, ready to link against.
* `newrelic-daemon`: the daemon binary, ready to run.

You can start the daemon in the foreground with:

```sh
./newrelic-daemon -f --logfile stdout --loglevel debug
```

Then you can invoke your instrumented application.  Your application,
which makes C SDK API calls, reports data to the daemon over a socket;
in turn, the daemon reports the data to New Relic.


## Tests

To compile and run the unit tests:

```sh
make run_tests
```

Or, just to compile them:

```sh
make tests
```
