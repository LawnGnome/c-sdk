#!/bin/bash
# publish.sh - publish to the testing repository.

### Usage: publish.sh [ -d ] --action=<action> --version=<version>
###
### Arguments:
###   --action=<action>     publish action to perform, e.g. release-2-testing
###   --version=<version>   agent version to deploy, e.g 1.0.1
###
### Options:
###   -d  output the aws commands that would execute if this
###   script were run without the aws cli --dry-run option.
###
### Description:
###
###   Publishing the C Agent proceeds in three phases: pull, modify, push.
###   The three phases are designed to ensure the publication process is
###   atomic. Changes should not be visible to customers unless they are
###   complete. To achieve this goal, this script never makes direct
###   changes to the public download website.
###
###   The first phase, the "pull" phase, uses the AWS CLI[0] tools to
###   synchronize the local copy with the current contents of the public
###   download site. Warning: Synchronizing will remove any files present
###   in the local copy, but not present on the download site.
###
###   During the second phase, the "modify" phase, each of the files
###   comprising an agent release is copied to the appropriate location
###   within the download site.
###
###   The third and final phase, the "push" phase, completes the publication
###   of the C Agent. This phase uploads the changes made during the "modify"
###   phase to the download site. As in the "pull" phase, the AWS CLI[0] tools
###   are used perform the synchronization.
