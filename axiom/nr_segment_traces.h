 * Segment Iteration Userdata
 *
 * To parametrically iterate over a tree of segments, the requisite callback
 * function takes two parameters, a pointer to a particular segment and a
 * pointer to userdata.  Traversing a segment of trees to generate a trace
 * requires that a brief list of data are available to each segment in the tree.
 * These comprise the userdata.
