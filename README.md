# New Relic C Agent

A generic library to communicate with New Relic from any language with a C FFI
mechanism.

## Building the agent

### Requirements

* gcc or clang (any version in the last ten years is likely fine)
* cmake
* golang 1.4+
* libpcre 8.20+

Note that the unit tests require cmocka 1.1.1 or later, but this is vendored in
the `vendor` directory.

### Agent

Building the agent should be as simple as:

```sh
make
```

This will create a `libnewrelic.a` in this directory, ready to link against.

### Daemon

To build the daemon, run:

```sh
make daemon
```

This creates `php_agent/bin/daemon`. You can then start the daemon in the
foreground with:

```sh
./php_agent/bin/daemon -f --logfile stdout --loglevel debug
```

## Using the agent

API usage information can be found in [the guide](GUIDE.md).

### Headers

Note that only `include/libnewrelic.h` contains the stable, public API. Other
header files are internal to the agent, and their stability is not guaranteed.

### API reference

You can use [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) to generate API reference
documentation:

```sh
doxygen
```

This will create HTML output in the `html` directory.

## Running tests

### Unit tests

To compile and run the unit tests:

```sh
make run_tests
```

Or, just to compile them:

```sh
make tests
```

### Ad hoc tests

A number of ad hoc tests have been provided. More information can be found in
[the ad hoc test readme](tests/adhoc/README.md).
