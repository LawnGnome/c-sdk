 *           it should be created before and destroyed after multiple threads
 *           have access to it.

 * Purpose : Returns the file descriptor used to communicate with the daemon.
 *           If the daemon failed to initialize or the connection has been lost
 *           or closed, will return -1.
 *
 * Returns : The daemon file descriptor or -1.

 *           be done even if nr_get_daemon_fd does not return a valid

 * which gets a file descriptor using this function can not guarantee that
 * another thread does not close the fd.

 *           connection attempt fails, no warning messages will be printed,

 *           ever be communicating with the daemon at 1 time, in order to
 *           prevent data interleaving and trying to multiplex commands and
 *           their replies.
 *
 * Params  : None.

 * Returns : NR_SUCCESS or NR_FAILURE.
 *
